1. Detect refresh on StudySession page and save timer duration to localStorage before allowing
    - needs improvement (still needs improvement, but much better now)
2. Make sure "Last studied on..." is working properly
3. On creating an account, set userData in user context
4. bug: delete a card, then add new card.  new card doesn't seem to show up without refresh

NICE TO HAVE(s)
1. User shouldn't be able to "save" after 'editing' unless a change was made to the card
2. Have separate toolbar module for front of card editor.
    Default to center, Huge text, and bold
3. Social Auth 
  - At least facebook, maybe google and twitter
4. Some kind of cool lightning loader
5. A true "center" class for back of card that will force content to vertical/horizontal center of card
6. User settings page where they can change...
    - default styles for front and back of cards
