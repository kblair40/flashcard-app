1. Detect refresh on StudySession page and save timer duration to localStorage before allowing
    - needs improvement (still needs improvement, but much better now)
2. Clicking "New Card" in SetControls, front of card styles all apply EXCEPT font size.
    - https://quilljs.com/docs/api/
        - Look at disabling and enabling editor, and associated events
3. Style improvements to AuthModal (still might want/need more)
4. On Home page, try to use data from context instead of own fetches
5. makeDisplayName helper should see if first + last is greater than 12 chars and render only first name if true
6. Signup/in forms should be submittable with enter key

NICE TO HAVE(s)
1. User shouldn't be able to "save" after 'editing' unless a change was made to the card
2. Social Auth 
  - At least facebook, maybe google and twitter
3. Some kind of cool lightning loader
4. A true "center" class for back of card that will force content to vertical/horizontal center of card
