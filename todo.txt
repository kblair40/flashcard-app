1. Detect refresh on StudySession page and save timer duration to localStorage before allowing
    - needs improvement
2. Better random shuffle function for cards
3. Add tooltip to navbar when things are disabled OR allow 
    clicks and have them open signup modal


NICE TO HAVE(s)
1. User shouldn't be able to "save" after 'editing' unless a change was made to the card
2. Have separate toolbar module for front of card editor.
    Default to center, Huge text, and bold
4. Social Auth 
  - At least facebook, maybe google and twitter
5. Some kind of cool lightning loader
