1. Detect refresh on StudySession page and save timer duration to localStorage before allowing
    - needs improvement
2. History order needs to stay in reverse if history item gets deleted
3. More checks to make user confirm they want to delete something
4. Prevent duplicates in favorites
5. GoBack component should navigate(-1) or something similar instead of hardcoded back to home route



NICE TO HAVE(s)
1. User shouldn't be able to "save" after 'editing' unless a change was made to the card
2. Have separate toolbar module for front of card editor.
    Default to center, Huge text, and bold
4. Social Auth 
  - At least facebook, maybe google
5. Some kind of cool lightning loader
